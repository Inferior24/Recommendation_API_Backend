# 03 — Data Preparation

The data preparation phase ensures that the raw technical documentation is converted into clean, structured, and chunk-ready text.

Key steps:

1. Data normalization
2. Duplicate removal
3. Stopword handling (without losing technical context)
4. Chunking based on:
   - Semantic boundaries
   - Code block detection
   - Heading structure
5. Metadata generation:
   - File source
   - Section labels
   - Parent hierarchy
   - Token length

The quality of embeddings and retrieval depends heavily on this stage.
