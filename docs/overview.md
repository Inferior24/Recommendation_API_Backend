# 00 — Project Overview

The API Recommendation & Query Assistant Optimizer is an intelligent retrieval and ranking system designed to help developers and users quickly locate the most relevant API, function, or technical information.

It acts as an internal knowledge engine capable of:

- Converting raw textual data into structured embeddings
- Building a vector-based semantic search index
- Retrieving contextually relevant items
- Ranking them using a hybrid scoring model
- Providing final recommendations through FastAPI endpoints
- Extending into a conversational RAG assistant

The system is modular, scalable, and optimized for fast queries even on large datasets.
