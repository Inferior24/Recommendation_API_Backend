# 01 — Problem Statement

Technical teams often struggle to locate correct API references, function descriptions, or usage examples inside large documentation sets. Traditional keyword search is slow, imprecise, and often returns irrelevant results.

The system is designed to solve:

- Slow discovery of relevant API details
- Inconsistent or missing metadata in documentation
- Difficulty correlating queries with the correct function/module
- Lack of contextual ranking beyond keyword matching
- No unified interface for recommendation, querying, and evaluation

This project builds a structured pipeline capable of producing fast, accurate, and context-aware API recommendations.
